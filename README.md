# testgame

This game demostrates the interop framework of codeKid.

To understand how it works:
1. Launch the app in Chrome using VSCode
2. Open browser console (Inspector)
3. Write 'myDartFunction('hello world')' in console and execute

You should see the message: 'say hello world' on the screen.

The javascript function was called and the message was received in Flutter app (the game) to be printed on the screen.

The games will be created in Flutter.
But kids should be able to program some functionality (that is exposed by the game publisher) using javascript.
